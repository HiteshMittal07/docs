# Pricing & Rate Limits

## Overview

In order for the network to be sustainable & decentralized, Gelato Nodes charge fees for running off-chain computation and executing transactions.

Our default method is to pay for all your Web3 Function costs across all networks from a single balance using [Gelato 1Balance](/relay/subscription-and-payments/1balance-and-relay).

By default, users are on the free plan, but they can upgrade to a higher tier based on their request limits.

## Transaction Charges

Each transaction that Gelato Nodes execute require a small fee to incentivize Nodes to adhere to the protocol and get your transactions included into your desired blockchain in a fast and secure fashion. 

To achieve this, Nodes charge a fee as a percentage of total gas cost for the executed transaction. This varies across networks - Nodes charge higher premiums on cheaper networks and vice versa.

| Network | Percentage Premium (%) |
|---------|------------------------|
| Clink | 20 |

*Note - Fee premiums as a percentage of total gas cost per network. Testnet transactions are subsidized by Gelato.*

## Request Limits

Oracle requests are using Gelato Web3 functions under the hood, which subsidize the first 10,000 requests per months. If you target an higher number of requests, please check [Web3 functions subscriptions plans](/web3-functions/subscription-and-payments/web3-functions-pricing) to upgrade to an higher tier.
