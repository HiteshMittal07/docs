title: Create a Oracle Task
---

# Quick Start

After reading this page:

- You'll be guided through a step-by-step decision process to seamlessly integrate with gelato oracle by creating tasks on the Gelato app.

> **Note:** Our Oracle is currently in its beta version, [Apply here](https://tally.so/r/w3f) for access.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Oracle Task

Access the [Gelato Dashboard](https://app.gelato.network) and create a new Oracle task.

This task will define how price data is fetched, checked for deviations, and updated on-chain.

### 2. Choose a Data Provider

Gelato currently supports two primary data providers for price feeds:

- **Stork**
- **Chaos Labs** (Coming soon)

Select the provider that aligns best with your data requirements and coverage needs.

### 3. Select the Required Price Feeds

- Review the available price feeds for each data provider.
- Confirm that the assets or markets you need to monitor are available.

### 4. Pick Your Network

Refer to the [supported networks](/oracles/additional-resources/supported-networks) to ensure your target blockchain is compatible with Gelato Oracles.

### 5. Configure Heartbeat and Frequency

#### Heartbeat
- Specifies how often the price feed should be updated, even when there is no significant price deviation.
- Ensures periodic data freshness and reliability.

#### Frequency & Deviation
- Defines how frequently the system checks for price deviations (e.g., every 2 minutes).
- If the deviation threshold you set (e.g., 0.02%) is exceeded, the Oracle task automatically updates the on-chain price feed.

Following these steps will help you set up an efficient, automated Oracle task on Gelato, enabling your smart contracts to operate with the most reliable and up-to-date price information.
