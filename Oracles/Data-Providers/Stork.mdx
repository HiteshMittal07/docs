# Stork

After reading this page:

- You'll go through a process to understand the way to integrate Stork price feeds after creating task on Gelato app.

> **Note:** Please create oracle tasks using the UI available in the oracle section of the Gelato App. Manual creation via web3-functions is discouraged to ensure proper configuration and operation.

## Initial Steps

### 1. Create an Oracle Task in the Gelato App

As outlined in the [Quick Start guide](/oracles/how-to-guides/create-a-oracle-task), begin by creating a new Oracle Task in the Gelato App. Select Stork as your data provider and choose the specific price feeds you wish to monitor. This setup ensures your application receives real-time data from the selected pairs.

### 2. Fund Your Dedicated msg.sender Address

It is necessary to pass deposit some ETH to your dedicated msg.sender because Stork enforces a fee for each price update. This fee is calculated dynamically based on the number of updates you submit, though in most cases, it amounts to just 1 WEI per update. To prevent transaction reversion, ensure that your dedicated msg.sender address is sufficiently funded to cover these fees.

### 3. Integrate the Price Feeds into Your Smart Contract

Once your Oracle Task is live, you can pull the associated price feeds into your smart contract. For a list of Stork contract addresses and integration details, refer to the [Supported Networks](/oracles/additional-resources/supported-networks). Incorporate these feeds into your contract's logic as needed to automate on-chain functions with reliable, accurate market data.

## Example Code

```solidity
// YourContract.sol
contract YourContract {
    IStork public stork;
    // ...
    constructor (address _stork /*, ...*/) {
        stork = IStork(_stork);
        // ...
    }
    //...
}

interface IStork {
    function getTemporalNumericValueUnsafeV1(
        bytes32 id
    ) external view returns (StorkStructs.TemporalNumericValue memory value);
}

contract StorkStructs {
    struct TemporalNumericValue {
        // slot 1
        // nanosecond level precision timestamp of latest publisher update in batch
        uint64 timestampNs; // 8 bytes
        // should be able to hold all necessary numbers (up to 6277101735386680763835789423207666416102355444464034512895)
        int192 quantizedValue; // 8 bytes
    }
}
