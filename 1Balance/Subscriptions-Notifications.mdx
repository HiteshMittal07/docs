## Available notifications

You will be notified when:

- An upcoming subscription payment is due
- A subscription has been successfully renewed
- If there has been an issue renewing your subscription
- Renewal has not been possible and your subscription has been downgraded

We will be expanding the range of notifications available.

## Stopping notifications

The best way to stop notifications is to go to your notifications settings and delete your email. 

You can also use the unsubscribe links in your emails but note that if you do this and then try to reactivate it you will need to notify us to remove you from the suppression list.
