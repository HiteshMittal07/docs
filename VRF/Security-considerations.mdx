<Tip>
After reading this page you will:

- Understand the importance of security measures when implementing Gelato VRF in your dApp.
- Recognize the need for state locking to prevent front-running and maintain the integrity of the randomization process.
- Learn the benefits of using RNGLib to ensure the randomness you receive is unique and secure, particularly when handling multiple requests simultaneously.

## Important Note

> Contrary to some other VRF providers, Gelato VRF is verifiable off-chain but not on-chain. This is due to the nature of the BLS signatures used by Drand network, which are not yet supported at EVM level. With the upcoming EIP-2537 release, adding BLS precompile for BLS12-381 curve, we aim to add support for on-chain randomness verification in a near future on all networks that will include this precompile.

## Security Precautions

When integrating with GelatoVRF, it's essential to take several precautions to ensure the safety and reliability of your application. Here are key considerations:

### 1. State Locking and Front-Running Prevention

After you initiate a request for randomness and before the random number gets delivered, it's essential to lock the relevant application state in your consumer contract. This step minimizes the risk of front-running attacks.

In essence, front-running involves gaining an unfair advantage by making transactions based on foreknowledge of pending transactions. By locking the state, you add an additional layer of security against such tactics.

### 2. Usage of RNGLib

Instead of using the received randomness directly, consider integrating it with our RNGLib. This approach:

- Enables dynamic fetching of random values as required.
- Offers protection against certain bet arbitrage attacks, especially when multiple applications operate simultaneously.

By inheriting from `GelatoVRFConsumerBase.sol`, your contract will automatically benefit from enhanced security. All fulfilled randomness requests will be dynamically derived from the drand randomness using a pseudo-random number generator (RNG). This is crucial to ensure the uniqueness of values, particularly for concurrent requests, and adds another layer of protection against potential vulnerabilities.
