# Create a Fallback VRF

Fallback VRF is a mechanism designed to fulfill missing or unfulfilled VRF requests. By creating a fallback task alongside your main VRF task, you can ensure that all requests are fulfilled in any scenario.

Setting up a fallback task for VRF is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create one.

## 1. Deploy VRF Compatible Contract

Before deploying Fallback VRF, ensure that your contract is compatible with VRF. You can quickly set up one by heading over to the [quick start guide](/vrf/how-to-guides/deploy-your-contract-inheriting-gelato-vrf).

## 2. Select Deployment Network

Navigate to the [Gelato app](https://app.gelato.network) and ensure you choose the same network where both your Main VRF task and VRF compatible contracts are deployed.

## 3. Enter Fallback Parameters 

Fallback VRF has three main parameters:

- **From Block**: The block number from which the fallback will start analyzing missing events. It is recommended to use the block number of your VRF-compatible contract deployment.

- **Time**: The interval at which the fallback task checks for missing events.

- **Contract Address**: The address of your deployed VRF-compatible contract.

## 4. Launch your Fallback VRF Instance

Once all details are correctly entered, go ahead and launch your Fallback Gelato VRF instance.
