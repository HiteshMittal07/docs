# Create a VRF Task

Creating your Gelato VRF Task is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

## 1. Gather Necessary Addresses

Before you begin, make sure you have the address of your requester contract at hand. This will be essential for the deployment process. 

Head over to the [VRF Quick Start guide](/vrf/how-to-guides/deploy-your-contract-inheriting-gelato-vrf) to learn how to prepare your contract for requesting randomness.

## 2. Access the VRF Deployment Portal

Navigate to the [Gelato app](https://app.gelato.network).

## 3. Choose your VRF Type

When prompted to select the VRF type, opt for "Gelato VRF". If you previously deployed a Chainlink consumer contract and wish to transition, refer to the [Migrate from Chainlink VRF](/vrf/how-to-guides/migrate-from-chainlink-vrf) section. 

Or, if you already have a VRF task and want to cover all the missing events, you can set up a fallback task to ensure completeness, refer to the [Create a Fallback VRF](/vrf/how-to-guides/create-a-fallback-vrf) section.

## 4. Select Deployment Network

Ensure you choose the same network where both your VRF requester and receiver contracts are deployed.

## 5. Specify the Request Contract

You'll be asked to provide the address of the Request Contract to which the Gelato nodes should respond. Enter the address you gathered in step 1.

## 6. Launch your VRF Instance

Once all details are correctly entered, go ahead and launch your Gelato VRF instance.
