<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Gelato Account">
    Sign up on the [Gelato App](https://relay.gelato.network/) to establish an account. This account is the foundation for setting up relay tasks and managing gas sponsorships.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Relay App">
    Within your Gelato account, create a relay app on the specific network where you plan to sponsor transactions. This step enables sponsored transactions on your chosen chain. Checkout supported networks [here](/Relay/Additional-Resources/Supported-networks)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve Your Sponsor API Key">
    After creating the relay app, navigate to its dashboard to locate your Sponsor API Key. This key links your Gelato setup with 1Balance for gas sponsorship.

    <Check>Gelato Relay now supports API key rotation, allowing users to create and delete API keys. This helps prevent unauthorized usage in case an API key is exposed.</Check>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deposit Funds into 1Balance">
    Add funds to your 1Balance account according to your target environment:

    - **Mainnets**: Deposit USDC.
    - **Testnets**: Deposit Sepolia ETH.

    Since 1Balance is deployed on Polygon, you can deposit USDC in one step, and deposits from other networks are supported via Circle CCTP. Learn more.
