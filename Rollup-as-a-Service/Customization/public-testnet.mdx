### 1. Minting CGT on Arb Sepolia
Begin by visiting the designated faucet for Arb Sepolia to mint your CGT. This initial step is crucial for obtaining the gas token needed for transactions on Arbitrum Blueberry. Access the faucet [here](https://raas.gelato.network/rollups/details/public/arb-blueberry).
