Bridges allow interoperability in blockchain is the ability for different blockchain systems to communicate and transact with each other seamlessly.

## LayerZero (Natively Integrated)

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) is Omnichain communication for your L2 that supports direct, trust-minimized communication across multiple blockchain networks.

Developers can easily send arbitrary data, external function calls, and tokens with omnichain messaging while preserving full autonomy and control over their application.

## Connext

[Connext](https://www.connext.network/) securely interacts with users, tokens, and other applications on any chain with your L2.

Connext is live with:

1. **Modular bridge**: Design for tailored, secure cross-chain communication, adapting to various transaction needs while ensuring maximum security through an optimal path and an optimistic verification layer.

2. **xERC20**: Cross-chain iteration of ERC-20, ensuring seamless transfers across chains without slippage or security compromises.

## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/) connects your rollup with any blockchain leveraging the permissionless interoperability layer, right out-of-the-box.

Hyperlane is live with:

1. **Messaging**: Utilize on-chain API to seamlessly send and receive interchain messages across any blockchain network.

2. **Interchain Accounts**: Easily create and manage accounts on remote chains without the requirement for deploying on those specific chains.

3. **Warp Routes**: Bridge any token to any chain without restrictions using Hyperlane, eliminating the need for token whitelisting.

4. **Interchain Queries**: Conveniently query the state of any contract on any chain supported by Hyperlane, and effortlessly bring Oracle services to your blockchain or rollup.
