1. **User Control**: Users have full ownership and control over their identity data. They can edit, grant, or revoke access to interact with dApps.

2. **Secure Data Storage**: Node operators store encrypted user data safely.

3. **dApp Integration**: dApps can request read or write access to user data or credentials.

4. **Identity Verification**: Providers check user data, issue credentials, and may add them to the user's idOS profile.
