## Contract Addresses
Web3 Functions during the private beta uses a custom deployment of the `Automate.sol` contract as an entry point.

On the Automate smart contract users create or cancel and Gelato executes tasks. By default, Web3 Functions uses the dedicated msg.sender module, which means all transactions to the defined destination contract will be routed via your dedicated msg.sender proxy contract.

> **Note:** If you have an access restriction in your smart contract function and want to whitelist your personal Gelato smart contract wallet as a msg.sender, you don't need to do anything. We automatically deploy your own dedicated msg.sender for you at the first task creation - the address to whitelist will be shown in the UI and can also be retrieved via the Automate SDK.
