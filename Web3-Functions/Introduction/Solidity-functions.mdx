# Solidity Functions

## What are Solidity Functions?
Solidity functions are essentially a piece of logic written in Solidity that determines whether certain conditions are met to execute a task.

Solidity Functions enable automation in conjunction with the various trigger types outlined on our [Trigger Types](/Web3-Functions/Introduction/Trigger-types) page. 

## Essential Role of Solidity Functions

### Ensure Precision
They ensure that functions are triggered only when the right conditions are met.

### Boost Efficiency
By automating repetitive and conditional tasks, they save time and resources.

### Enhance Flexibility
Developers can encode a variety of conditions, allowing for a wide range of automated functionalities.

## Scenarios for Solidity Function Automation

### On-Chain Logic is Required
Use them when the logic for your automation needs to reside entirely on the blockchain.

### Fine tune gas price
Limit the gas price of the execution ensuring your automation doesn't overpay network fees. 

### Security and Immutability are Key
Automated tasks that require the highest level of security benefit from Solidity's immutable contract execution environment.
