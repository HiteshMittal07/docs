# Understanding Web3 Functions

## Determining your Needs

### Off-chain Data or Computation?
Sometimes, automation tasks require data that isn't readily available on the blockchain, or they might need computations that are better performed off-chain. In such cases, Typescript Functions should be the choice.

### All Checks On-chain?
If all the conditions necessary for your automation task can be directly verified on the blockchain, you have the option to select between Typescript Functions, Solidity Functions & Automated Transactions.

## Implementation path

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| How you want to trigger your run? | Start by deciding on the type of trigger you want to use. (Time, event, or every block) |
| What to run? | - Typescript Function<br/>- Solidity Function<br/>- Transaction |
| Task Creation | Create a Web3 Function task to allow the execution of typescript, solidity or transaction |
| Finalize & Monitor | Once you've defined your function ensure you monitor its execution to confirm that it works as expected. Make any necessary adjustments. |

## Core Features of Web3 Functions

Main features of Web3 Functions include Typescript Functions, Solidity Functions & Automated Transactions.

Before jumping into the core features of the Web3 Functions, it is highly recommended that you first learn how you'd like to trigger your run. To learn more:

- [Automated Transactions](/Web3-Functions/Introduction/Automated-transactions)

## Pre-Requisite of Target Smart Contract

Smart contract functions in the target contract that can be automated should follow these properties:

- They need to be functions that are usually called by the development team or external keepers, not "user facing" functions called by users directly
- They need to be either public or external
- They do not have access restrictions like an onlyOwner modifier, unless the user's dedicated msg.sender address is whitelisted through the proxy module
- They do not require msg.sender to be tx.origin
