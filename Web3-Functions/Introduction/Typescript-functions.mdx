# Typescript Functions

## What are Typescript Functions?
Typescript Functions are decentralized cloud functions. They enable developers to execute on-chain transactions based on arbitrary off-chain data (APIs / subgraphs, etc) & computation. These functions are written in Typescript, stored on IPFS and run by Gelato. 

Typescript Functions enable automation in conjunction with the various trigger types outlined on our [Trigger Types](/Web3-Functions/Introduction/Trigger-types) page. 

## Essential Role of Typescript Functions

### Seamless Integration with Off-Chain Data
They provide an elegant solution for incorporating real-time data from the outside world, enabling smart contracts to respond to external events and changes.

### Enhanced Computation Capabilities
Typescript Functions allow for complex calculations that would be too gas-intensive to perform on-chain, facilitating more sophisticated decision-making processes in your DApps.

### Customizable Logic Execution
Developers can bring the full power of Typescript to create flexible advanced logic to deliver their application use cases.
