# Trigger Types

## 1. Time Interval
Use this trigger to execute tasks at regular intervals, e.g., every 10 minutes or once every 24 hours. It's like setting a straightforward, recurring alarm.

## 2. Cron Expressions
This offers a more refined control compared to the Time Interval. With cron expressions, you can set tasks to run at specific moments, such as "every Tuesday at 3 PM" or "on the 1st of every month". It gives you precision in task scheduling.

## 3. On-Chain Event
Ideal for those wanting their tasks to respond dynamically to blockchain activities. Whenever a specified event occurs on the blockchain, e.g. 

```solidity, sol
//event creation with argument types and names
event ownerChanged(address indexed _from, address indexed _to);
```

this trigger springs your task into action. 

## 4. Every Block
This function operates with the rhythm of the blockchain itself, executing your chosen function each time a new block is created.

## Note
Irrespective of the trigger type you opt for, you can tie it to running any of the following:
