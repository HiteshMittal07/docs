# Test, Deploy & Run Solidity Functions

## Testing Solidity Functions
The purpose of this repo is to showcase unit tests examples of using Gelato Solidity Functions in a Hardhat environment.

[GitHub - gelatodigital/gelato-solidity-functions-unit-testing](https://github.com/gelatodigital/gelato-solidity-functions-unit-testing)

It's advised to conduct tests by impersonating Gelato's address within a Hardhat environment to ensure accurate simulation of Gelato Solidity Function executions.

## Deploying Solidity Functions
To deploy your Solidity functions, please proceed with deploying your contract to the network. Once deployed, ensure you verify your contract on Etherscan to enable automatic ABI fetching within our app.

## Creating Solidity Function Tasks
Before creating solidity function tasks, familiarize yourself with the available Trigger Types!

### Selection of Function
1. Navigate to the What to trigger section.
2. Choose the Solidity Function option

### Network Configuration
1. Locate the Network dropdown.
2. Select your desired blockchain network where the contract is deployed, e.g., "GÃ¶erli."

### Function Details Input
1. Under the Solidity Function section, find the input labeled Contract Address.
2. Enter the Ethereum address of your deployed Solidity contract. Ensure accuracy as this determines where your functions will interact.
3. Once the contract address is entered, the ABI (Application Binary Interface) should automatically populate. If using a custom ABI, select the Custom ABI option and input it accordingly.

### Task Configuration
A checker function evaluates conditions before triggering the main function. From the Checker Function dropdown, choose the specific function you want as a condition checker.

Enter the Target Contract where the automated function call should be sent. From the subsequent dropdown, select the specific function you wish to automate.
