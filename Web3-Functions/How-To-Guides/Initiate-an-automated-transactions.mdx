# Initiate an Automated Transaction

An execution attempt in Gelato allows you to pre-define the inputs for a function. By doing so, every time Gelato calls the function, it uses the same arguments, ensuring consistent behavior in your automated tasks.

## 1. Prepare Your Smart Contract for Automation

### Identify Your Smart Contract
Ensure you have the correct smart contract address and know the specific function you want to automate.

### Function Restrictions
Some functions may not be compatible with Gelato due to certain restrictions. Familiarize yourself with these to ensure seamless automation.

## 2. Set Your Trigger Condition

### Choosing Your Trigger
Gelato allows you to set specific conditions to determine when your function is called. This could be at regular intervals (time interval) or based on specific events (cron expression).

### No Custom Code Required
For initiating tranaction tasks, there's no need for you to write code. Simply set your desired trigger and move forward.
