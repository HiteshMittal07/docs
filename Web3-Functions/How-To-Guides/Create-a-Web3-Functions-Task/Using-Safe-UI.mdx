We recommend using our custom app within Safe for a more reliable connection and smoother user experience. Wallet Connect does sometimes encounter issues and is not recommended.

## Setting up Custom Gelato App in Safe

<Steps>
<Step title="Accessing Safe App">
Access the official Gnosis Safe website: https://safe.global/

Once there, locate and click on the "Launch Wallet" button, highlighted in green and situated in the top right corner.

<Step title="Sign-in with Safe Signature">
After completing these steps, you'll be required to sign in through the Safe UI:

If your Safe requires multiple signatures (multi-sig) the sign-in process will need approvals from the minimum number of signers set for your Safe before it can complete

And that's it! You now have full access to the Gelato app!
