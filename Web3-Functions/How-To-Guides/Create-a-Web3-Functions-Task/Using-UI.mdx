# Using the UI

## Creating a Web3 Function Task via the UI
This method is ideal for developers or operators who prefer a graphical interface for task configuration. For instance, if you're a developer who wants to quickly test a function or a non-technical person looking to schedule a recurring job without writing any code.

In order to create a task that will automatically run your Web3 Function on your behalf, go to https://app.gelato.network/ and click on the "Create Task" button.

## Single Execution Task
If you want to have Gelato call your function only once. If so, you can open up the Advanced Settings panel when creating a new task and select Single execution task

> **Note:** The task will still be canceled if the execution reverts on-chain
