The Gelato Smart Wallet React SDK brings the power of Account Abstraction (EIP-7702) to your dApp with a single, modular SDK. Instantly upgrade existing EOA wallets to smart accounts, integrate embedded wallets with familiar logins, and enable advanced features like gas sponsorship and ERC-20 fee payments â€” all without requiring migrations.

## The Challenges of Traditional Wallets

Traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) come with significant limitations:

- Manual gas fee handling for users
- Cumbersome onboarding with seed phrases
- Poor UX and low retention
- Limited support for gasless or token-based transactions

These barriers increase development overhead and hinder mainstream user adoption.

## Gelato's Smart Wallet SDK to the Rescue

Gelato's SDK offers a complete solution for building and upgrading smart wallets:

- **Instant Upgrades**: Seamlessly convert EOAs to smart accounts using EIP-7702
- **Embedded Wallets**: Enable one-click wallet creation using email, phone, or social logins
- **Gas Abstraction**: Support gasless transactions and ERC-20 token payments across EVM chains
- **Cross-Chain Native**: Consistent UX across all supported EVM-compatible chains

## Key Features

- **Single SDK Integration**: Integrate smart wallet capabilities with just a few lines of code. Get to production in hours, not days.
- **High Performance**: Engineered for low latency and optimized gas usage for fast, efficient user interactions.
- **Unified Dashboard**: Manage API keys, view analytics, track usage, and handle billing from a single interface.
- **Embedded Wallets**: Allow users to create wallets instantly through familiar login flows such as email, phone, or social accounts.
- **Gas Abstraction**: Sponsor transaction gas fees or allow users to pay with ERC-20 tokens on any supported network.
- **Advanced Security**: Includes social recovery, multi-factor authentication (MFA), spending limits, and session management.

## Developer-Friendly and Scalable

The React SDK is built with modern development standards:

- TypeScript support
- Hook-based architecture
- Context APIs
