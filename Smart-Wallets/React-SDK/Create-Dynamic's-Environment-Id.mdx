<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Gelato Account">
    Sign up on the [Gelato RaaS Dashboard](https://raas.gelato.network/dashboard) to create an account and begin setting up wallet providers like Dynamic using the Smart Wallet React SDK.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Wallets Project">
    Once you're logged into your Gelato account, navigate to create a new Wallet Project. This project will serve as the foundation for managing your wallet providers and configurations.

  <Step title="Retrieve Your Environment ID">
    After creating the Wallet Project, navigate to its dashboard to find your Environment ID.

    Click on View Config, then either copy the Dynamic's Environment ID or the entire configuration code, depending on your needs.
