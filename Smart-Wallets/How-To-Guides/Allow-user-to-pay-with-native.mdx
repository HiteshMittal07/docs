import { NativeGasPaymentPlayground } from "/snippets/NativeGasPaymentPlayground.mdx";

Enabling users to pay gas fees with native tokens (like ETH) provides a straightforward way to handle transaction costs while maintaining full control over gas payments.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Importing Dependencies">
    ```typescript
    import { createGelatoSmartWalletClient, native } from "@gelatonetwork/smartwallet";
    import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem";
    import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creating a Wallet Client">
    Quickly get started by creating a wallet client using createWalletClient from viem with local account for your specified network.

    ```typescript
    const privateKey = (process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ?? generatePrivateKey()) as Hex;
    const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

    const client = createWalletClient({
      account,
      chain: baseSepolia,
      transport: http()
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Creating a Smart Wallet Client">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Smart Wallet (EIP-7702)">
        A Smart Wallet Client serves as an alternative to the standard viem walletClient, but is purpose-built for managing EOA's as smart wallets instead of traditional EOA (Externally Owned Accounts).

        To initialize a Smart Wallet Client, use the `createGelatoSmartWalletClient` method:

        ```typescript
        const smartWalletClient = createGelatoSmartWalletClient(client);
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Kernel Wallet (ERC-4337)">
        A Kernel Wallet Client serves as an alternative to the standard viem walletClient, but is purpose-built for managing smart contract wallets instead of traditional EOA (Externally Owned Accounts).

        Use `wallet: 'kernel'` when creating the Smart Wallet client to ensure ERC-4337 compatibility:

        ```typescript
        const kernelWalletClient = createGelatoSmartWalletClient(client, {
          wallet: "kernel"
        });
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sending Transactions">
    To send transactions with native gas payments, select Native as the payment method and ensure your account has enough native currency to cover the gas fees.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Smart Wallet (EIP-7702)">
        ```typescript
        const results = await smartWalletClient.execute({
          payment: native(),
          calls: [
            {
              to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
              data: "0xd09de08a",
              value: 0n
            }
          ]
        });

        console.log("userOp hash:", results?.id);
        const txHash = await results?.wait();
        console.log("transaction hash", txHash);
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Kernel Wallet (ERC-4337)">
        ```typescript
        const results = await kernelWalletClient.execute({
          payment: native(),
          calls: [
            {
              to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
              data: "0xd09de08a",
              value: 0n
            }
          ]
        });

        console.log("userOp hash:", results?.id);
        const txHash = await results?.wait();
        console.log("transaction hash", txHash);
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Batch Multiple Transactions">
    You can batch multiple transactions to be sent on-chain at once by adding them to the calls array:

    ```typescript
    const results = await smartWalletClient.execute({
      payment: native(),
      calls: [
        {
          to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
          data: "0xd09de08a",
          value: 0n
        },
        {
          to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
          data: "0xd09de08a",
          value: 0n
        },
        {
          to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
          data: "0xd09de08a",
          value: 0n
        }
      ]
    });
    ```

  </Step>
