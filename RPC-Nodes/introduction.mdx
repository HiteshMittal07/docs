Build on Gelato chains with access to enterprise-grade RPCs.

## Key Features

- **Elastic, Auto-scalable Nodes** : Our nodes automatically scale with your volume, ensuring optimal performance at all times.

- **Failover Support** :
Guaranteed uptime with redundancy across servers, data centers, and networks providing uninterrupted service to your users.

- **Monitoring Dashboard** : Monitor your compute usage, throughput, requests and more with dedicated RPC dashboard on the Gelato RaaS Platform.

- **Multi-Network Access** :
Easily access multiple networks with a single RPC key.

## Overview

Gelato RPC Nodes provide a fast and reliable production environment, enabling access to Gelato rollups via RPC. You can send transactions, deploy smart contracts, query blockchain data, and perform other operations without the need to run your own RPC node or manage infrastructure.
