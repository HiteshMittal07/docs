To fully leverage Gelato's high-performance RPC Node service, it's recommended to use authenticated access with API keys. While public endpoints are available, they are rate-limited, making API keys the optimal choice for consistent, scalable access.

When using an API key, Compute Units (CUs) are allocated at the organization level, meaning your usage is pooled across all networks and keys within your Gelato account. This provides a flexible way to manage your CU consumption across multiple projects. Creating an API key is quick and simple, enabling you to unlock seamless, high-performance access to Gelato-supported chains.

## Creating your API Key

To start accessing Gelato's high-performance RPC Nodes, you'll need to create an API key. The steps below outline how you can quickly generate and manage your API keys within the Gelato dashboard.

### Step 1: Navigate to the RPC Node section

Once logged in, go to the RPC Nodes section on the sidebar.

You will see a dashboard with your current plan details, including usage and available API keys.

Under My keys, click on the blue Create button.

### Step 2: Enter Key Name

A dialog box will appear, prompting you to name your new API key.

<Tip>
Choose a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "ProjectName-Mainnet" or "TestProject-RPC").
</Tip>

After entering the name, click Create to generate the key.

### Step 3: Manage and Use Your API Key

Your new API key will be listed under the My keys section.

You can now click on the key to view its details, including:

- Success rate (last 24 hours)
- Median response time
- Total requests
- CU usage and more

You'll also see the supported networks (HTTP and WebSocket endpoints) for your key at the bottom of the key details page.
